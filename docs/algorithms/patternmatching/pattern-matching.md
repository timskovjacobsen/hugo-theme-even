# Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is used for finding patterns inside text. Examples could be searching a document or a website.

Pattern matching in general deals with three standards terms.

* **Pattern**
  A string that we want to search for. A sequence of characters.

* **Text**
  The text in which we want to search for the pattern. This could be a document or a website and could be very long.

* **Alphabet**
  The pool of characters that are available to choose from. The characters should be looked as a set, i.e. distinct characters, but each one can be chosen multiple times.

!!! example
    A simple example problem is shown below.

    * **Alphabet:** $\{x, y, z\}$

    * **Pattern:** $xxxxxy$

    * **Text:** $xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxy$
