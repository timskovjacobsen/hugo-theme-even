# Map ADT

Maps are sometimes referred to as Dictionaries, for example in Python.

* Collection of key/value pairs
* Keys are unique in the map an must be immutable as modification to a key would ruin the lookup integrity
* Values are looked up by their keys and need not be unique, values can mutable or immutable
* Keys are unordered by default, but can be ordered in non-standard implementations
* $O(1)$ lookup time

The **Map ADT** supports the operations listed in the table below

| Method           | Description                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `put(key, value)`        | Add `key` and `value` to the Map as a key/value pair.<br>If `key` already exists, overwrite its value and return the previous value. Otherwise, return `null` |
| `remove(key)` | Remove `key` and return its value |
| `search(key)` | Lookup `key` and return its value |
| `set(key)` | Return a Set of all keys in the Map |
| `list(key)` | Return a List of all values in the Map |
